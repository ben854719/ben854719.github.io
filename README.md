# About Me

I am Ben, a freelance data scientist on UpWork with work experience such as the private sector, non-profits organizations, and the Canadian government related to technology. My core foci are artificial intelligence, software development, and cybersecurity. I am known for delivering data-driven solutions that directly influence and improve business strategies.

# Toastmaster

I am a member of Toastmasters International since 2019; I currently belong to the McGill University Toastmasters Club. My journey has taken me to virtual meetings across Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec, Washington D.C., Geneva, and Japan. Toastmaster has helped by developing a strong command of public speaking, leadership, and presentation. It has improved my clarity, my confidence, and my adaptability when presenting complex ideas to different audiences.

## Projects:

### WASDE REVENUE IN 2024:

Description:

The project uses PyTorch for AI applications to analyze WASDE revenue. Matplotlib creates histograms explaining export and import revenues. Pandas is used for data       modeling and cleaning. LangChain prompts questions and answers for the LLM.
